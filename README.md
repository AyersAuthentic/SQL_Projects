## Poject 1: Analysis of Buisness Questions Using SQL
This project is to demonstrate advanced SQL techniques using a fictional database based on common databases that most businesses will use. Analysis will be done on a modified version of the database Chinook. The Chinook database contains information about a fictional digital music shop - similar to a type of mini-iTunes store.
